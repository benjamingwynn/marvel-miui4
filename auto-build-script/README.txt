This script is an add-on for dsixda's kitchen.
To let it work, make a virtual disk image named "Cooking".
Put the kitchen in there and also the stuff in this folder.
Then put your base ROMS in the original_update folder.
Follow the onscreen instructions and modify the script/change resources if necessary.

The script works out of the box for the HTC Wildfire S only. No support is given for other devices.
