possible fix for latest error

the ID links to boot_msg, found this in a smali. I haven't found it in an xml.

line 352 is before 394 in layoutinflater.smali in android/view of framework.jar

smalis which need possible mods:
- layoutinflater.smali
- miuiphonewindowmanager$6.smali => not sure about this one, its probably the other one. I removed some lines from it and it became even worse. Note the run in logcat, so its very important!

why not the other ones?
the first four are needed to "read" and load all the ids stored in xmls in different locations.
the android/os smalis are vital to load andrâ‰¤oid and shouldn't be modded I think.

There isn't a difference between CM9 for layoutinflater.smali
