Here you can find all the framework.jars to fix the network bugs.
Just test a framework.jar by installing it. 
If your phone boots and everything else works then test your network for some hours. 

- Check if the network connects after entering the pin code.
- Check if the signal goes away after a certain time (half hour or more).
