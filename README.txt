This is a placeholder for an attempt to port MIUI from git sources.
After some attempts I've started again. Now I'm stuck on a smali, someone needs to get a look at it.
I've tried replacing with CM9 and modding, but its still the same. Maybe compare with the ones from ace port?

No need to flash a rom or apply a zip, just remove/add files through recovery!
